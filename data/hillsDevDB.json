Following surveys of both peaks in 1846–47, Ben Nevis was confirmed as the higher.[3] Following these surveys, there were plans to build a cairn on the top of Ben Macdui to make its height greater than Ben Nevis, but these plans did not come to fruition.[4] The summit of the mountain has a direction indicator erected in 1925 by the Cairngorm Club of Aberdeen in memory of former president Alexander Copland. The indicator shows the directions of the most noteworthy mountains that can be seen from the summit in clear weather.[5]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Ben-macdui-from-carn-liath.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":525,"hillname":"Cairn Gorm","region":"08A","parent":518,"classification":"Hu,M,Sim,sMa","metres":1244.8,"feet":4084,"gridref":"NJ005040","gridref10":"NJ 00517 04056","colgridref":"NH 9989 0350","colheight":1099,"drop":145.8,"feature":"rock at base of large cairn","observations":"","survey":"Leica RX1250","revision":"2015-07-27","comments":"col measurement is 1099.0m","map50":"36","map25":"OL57S 403S","xcoord":300516,"ycoord":804065,"latitude":57.116714,"longitude":-3.644477,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":0,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":1,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Cairngorm_mountain_ski_resort_base_station.JPG/240px-Cairngorm_mountain_ski_resort_base_station.JPG","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cairngorm_mountain_ski_resort_base_station.JPG","description1":"Cairn Gorm is a mountain and listed Munro in the Scottish Highlands.

Since the 1950s, water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme. The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige, from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay.[4] The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344-metre-long Lawers Dam, a buttress-type dam that is 42 m high. Due to the height of this reservoir the static head of water is 415 m, the highest available on any hydro-electric scheme in Scotland.[6]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Ben_Lawers.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":529,"hillname":"Beinn a' Bhuird [Beinn a' Bhuird North Top]","region":"08B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":1197,"feet":3927,"gridref":"NJ092006","gridref10":"NJ 09232 00612","colgridref":"NJ033005","colheight":741,"drop":456,"feature":"cairn","observations":"","survey":"","revision":"2012-10-15","comments":"","map50":"36","map25":"OL58S 404S","xcoord":309231,"ycoord":800621,"latitude":57.08759,"longitude":-3.499366,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Beinn-a-bhuird-01.jpg/272px-Beinn-a-bhuird-01.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beinn-a-bhuird-01.jpg","description1":"Beinn a' Bhùird is a Munro in the Cairngorm mountain range of Scotland.\n","description2":"In Watson (1975) the author suggests the mountain should be named Beinn Bòrd - table hill, saying that local Scottish Gaelic speakers pronounced the mountain Paing Bòrd, with some of the older local folk still using Painna Bòrd.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Beinn-a-bhuird-01.jpg/800px-Beinn-a-bhuird-01.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":803,"hillname":"Carn Eighe","region":"11A","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim,CoH","metres":1182.8,"feet":3881,"gridref":"NH123261","gridref10":"NH 12358 26186","colgridref":"NN289971","colheight":36,"drop":1147,"feature":"trig point in shelter","observations":"","survey":"obvious summit/Leica RX1250","revision":"2017-12-13","comments":"","map50":"25","map25":"414N","xcoord":212355,"ycoord":826197,"latitude":57.287701,"longitude":-5.115159,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":1,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":1,"P500":1,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Carn_Eighe_from_Mam_Sodhail.jpg/272px-Carn_Eighe_from_Mam_Sodhail.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carn_Eighe_from_Mam_Sodhail.jpg","description1":"Càrn Eige, sometimes spelt Càrn Eighe (source required), is a mountain in the north of Scotland.

Yeaman in his Handbook of the Scottish Hills regarding Ceathreamhnan as the fourth most difficult Scottish Munro to climb, taking into account its remote position and its altitude. It is a massive mountain which covers 24 square miles (62 square km) and stands many kilometres from the nearest public road, it has a tent like appearance and throws down many long ridges to the valleys. It has five subsidiary “tops”, three of these stand on the northern ridge, they are Stuc Bheag (1075 metres), Stuc Mòr (1041 metres) and Stob Fraoch Choire (918 metres). The Western Top (1143 metres) is also regarded as a \"top\" as is Stob Coire na Cloiche (915 metres) on the eastern ridge. In addition to this Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan has three tops which have been deleted from the list over the years, making a total of eight distinct summits on the mountain in addition to the highest point.

All three peaks in the range may be climbed from Aberarder on the A86 road by initially following the path leading up Coire Ardair, before striking north to the summit of Càrn Liath. A circuit of the glen may be made by returning to Aberarder by way of Creag Meagaidh's east ridge. The most direct route to the summit of Creag Meagaidh ascends from the head of the corrie to reach a narrow gap between the crags known as The Window. The Window forms the bealach between Creag Meagaidh and Stob Poite Coire Ardair.

The fine corrie of Coire Easain Beag lies in between the two mountains facing north west. Stob Coire Easain’s name translates from the Gaelic as “Peak of the Corrie of the Little Waterfall”.[3] This mountain should not be confused with another Stob Coire Easain, a Munro “Top” on the Munro Stob Coire an Laoigh\n","description2":"The Easains stand in splendid isolation, hemmed in by valleys on three sides, giving Stob Coire Easain a substantial topographic prominence of 611 metres.[4] The mountain is the highest point on a nine kilometre long ridge which runs the entire length of the western side of Loch Treig; the eastern side of this ridge drops very steeply to the waters of the loch. To the west of the mountain is the valley of the Allt na Lairig. A subsidiary ridge going north from the summit is initially steep and craggy as it descends to the head of Coire Laire. To the south of the summit the main ridge descends gently over Irlick Chaoile to the lonely country at the head of Loch Treig.

The slopes into Glen Torridon on the south side are steep with few features and are covered in white quartzite screes.

However the current 1:25000 map shows a spot height of 1,005 metres, in better agreement with the trigonometric height of 3293.8 feet on old 6 inch maps (equivalent to 1004.1 metres after conversion to the Newlyn datum).\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Maoile_Lunndaidh_from_Moruisg.jpg/800px-Maoile_Lunndaidh_from_Moruisg.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":112,"hillname":"Beinn an Dothaidh","region":"02A","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":1004,"feet":3294,"gridref":"NN331408","gridref10":"NN 33180 40860","colgridref":"NN340405","colheight":757,"drop":247,"feature":"cairn","observations":"","survey":"","revision":"2001-10-28","comments":"","map50":"50","map25":"377E","xcoord":233177,"ycoord":740868,"latitude":56.53013,"longitude":-4.713981,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Beinn_an_Dothaidh_during_sunrise%2C_Scotland.jpg/272px-Beinn_an_Dothaidh_during_sunrise%2C_Scotland.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beinn_an_Dothaidh_during_sunrise,_Scotland.jpg","description1":"Beinn an Dòthaidh (from the Gaelic for 'hill of the scorching or singeing'), is a mountain in the Bridge of Orchy hills of Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

It is the fifth-highest mountain in Wales and has several walking and scrambling routes leading to its summit. According to Sir Ifor Williams, the word \"Glyder\" derives from the Welsh word \"Gludair\", meaning a heap of stones.[1]\n","description2":"Glyder Fawr is part of the Glyderau mountain range which lies to the northeast of the Snowdon massif, separated from that mountain by the Llanberis Pass and the Nant Peris Valley. Going from west to east, the Glyderau range consists of Elidir Fawr (924 m or 3,031 ft), Y Garn (947 m or 3,107 ft), Glyder Fawr (1,001 m or 3,284 ft), Glyder Fach (994 m or 3,261 ft) and Tryfan (918 m or 3,012 ft). To the north of the range lie the Carneddau, separated from the Glyderau by the Ogwen Valley and the Nant Ffrancon Valley. The Glyderau are separated from the surrounding mountain ranges making them stand out clearly from afar and giving them commanding views of the surrounding peaks and valleys.[2] Until late 2010, most maps showed the height of Glyder Fawr to be 999 metres (3,278 ft); however, the mountain was resurveyed with accurate GPS equipment and its height was found to be 1,000.8 m (3,283 ft 6 in). A spokesman from the Snowdonia National Park Authority was pleased by the new height, and suggested that now the mountain exceeded 1,000 m, it was sure to attract more walkers to the area.[3]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Glyder_Fawr_rocks.JPG/800px-Glyder_Fawr_rocks.JPG"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":828,"hillname":"Aonach Meadhoin","region":"11A","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":1001,"feet":3284,"gridref":"NH048137","gridref10":"NH 04885 13749","colgridref":"NH040138","colheight":827,"drop":174,"feature":"embedded rock 8m SSW of cairn","observations":"higher ground may exist under the cairn","survey":"Abney level","revision":"2012-11-10","comments":"","map50":"33","map25":"414N 414S","xcoord":204882,"ycoord":813760,"latitude":57.173026,"longitude":-5.229166,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Aonach_Meadhoin_from_Sgurr_a_Bhealaich_Dheirg.jpg/272px-Aonach_Meadhoin_from_Sgurr_a_Bhealaich_Dheirg.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aonach_Meadhoin_from_Sgurr_a_Bhealaich_Dheirg.jpg","description1":"Aonach Meadhoin is a Munro mountain situated in the Kintail region of Scotland.

This notable rocky corrie gives the  mountain its name which translates from the Gaelic as “Big Rocky Hillside” and this underlines the fact that Sgairneach Mhòr is the only hill in the group with any significant stony areas on its surface  and makes it the most visually striking of the Drumochter hills.[3][4]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Sgairneach_Mhor_from_Sow_of_Atholl.jpg/800px-Sgairneach_Mhor_from_Sow_of_Atholl.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":249,"hillname":"Beinn Eunaich","region":"03C","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":989,"feet":3245,"gridref":"NN135327","gridref10":"NN 13566 32789","colgridref":"NN104319","colheight":564,"drop":425,"feature":"cairn","observations":"","survey":"","revision":"2012-08-15","comments":"","map50":"50","map25":"377W","xcoord":213562,"ycoord":732797,"latitude":56.450352,"longitude":-5.026639,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Rowan_on_Sron_an_Isean._-_geograph.org.uk_-_64342.jpg/272px-Rowan_on_Sron_an_Isean._-_geograph.org.uk_-_64342.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rowan_on_Sron_an_Isean._-_geograph.org.uk_-_64342.jpg","description1":"Beinn Eunaich (989 m) is a mountain in the Grampian Mountains of Scotland, located north of the village of Dalmally in Argyll and Bute.\n","description2":"The mountain rises steeply out of Glen Strae and is usually climbed in conjunction with its neighbour Beinn a' Chochuill.[2]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Rowan_on_Sron_an_Isean._-_geograph.org.uk_-_64342.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":896,"hillname":"Lurg Mhor","region":"12A","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":987,"feet":3238,"gridref":"NH064404","gridref10":"NH 06483 40440","colgridref":"NH046423","colheight":545,"drop":442,"feature":"cairn on rock outcrop","observations":"outcrop at base of cairn is 20-30cm higher than rock c 40m WNW","survey":"Abney level","revision":"2012-11-10","comments":"","map50":"25","map25":"429","xcoord":206480,"ycoord":840451,"latitude":57.413091,"longitude":-5.223666,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Remote_Country_-_geograph.org.uk_-_120032.jpg/180px-Remote_Country_-_geograph.org.uk_-_120032.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remote_Country_-_geograph.org.uk_-_120032.jpg","description1":"Lurg Mhòr is a remote 986-metre (3,235 ft) mountain, a Munro, in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland at the high point of an east–west range of hills comprising Meall Mor (974 metres), Lurg Mhòr and Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich (945 metres).[6]\n","description2":"Lurg Mhòr, is situated west of Loch Monar[note 1] and east of the strath of Bearneas and the Attadale Forest, is one of a horseshoe of Munros around the loch.[7][6]  Glen Carron lies to the north and Glen Shiel to the south.[6] The west ridge of Lurg Mhòr curves round to the north before rising to Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich, a separate Munro.

Mullach nan Coirean differs, being a large sprawling mountain of ridges and corries with its granite rock giving the mountain a definite red shade (see picture). The mountain has three north facing corries: the finest of these is Coire Dearg (Red Corrie) which is drained by the Allt a' Choire Dheirg into Glen Nevis and is overlooked by Mullach nan Coirean’s South East Top (917 metres) which is listed as a \"top\" in Munro's Tables.[2][6] The South East Top was previously called \"Coire Dearg Top\" but was changed to avoid confusion as the main summit also overlooks Coire Dearg. The other two northern corries are smaller: Coire Riabhach also drains to Glen Nevis while Coire a’ Mhuillinn empties further west into the River Kiachnish which delineates the mountain's western boundary. A fourth corrie, Coire Carach stands on the mountain's southern slopes.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Mullach_nan_Coirean_from_Stob_Ban.jpg/800px-Mullach_nan_Coirean_from_Stob_Ban.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":739,"hillname":"Luinne Bheinn","region":"10B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,M,Sim","metres":939,"feet":3081,"gridref":"NG869007","gridref10":"NG 86983 00729","colgridref":"NG871001","colheight":684,"drop":255,"feature":"cairn","observations":"note there is also a cairn at the W end of the ridge at NG 86854 00821; this is 1m lower according to 1:25,000 map","survey":"","revision":"2009-11-20","comments":"","map50":"33","map25":"398E 413S","xcoord":186979,"ycoord":800740,"latitude":57.048325,"longitude":-5.513607,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":1,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":1,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Campsite%2C_Barrisdale._-_geograph.org.uk_-_14775.jpg/272px-Campsite%2C_Barrisdale._-_geograph.org.uk_-_14775.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Campsite,_Barrisdale._-_geograph.org.uk_-_14775.jpg","description1":"Luinne Bheinn (939 m) is a mountain in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, on the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber.\n","description2":"The mountain is rough and rocky.

The name \"Tryfan\" is thought to derive from the intensifying particle try– and the noun ban (‘top, peak’), giving the meaning ‘very high peak’.[3] Tryfan was voted Britain's favourite mountain by Trail magazine.[4]\n","description2":"Between the mid-1980s and June 2010, its accepted height was 915 metres (3,002 ft).

The mountain's translated name of “Hill of the Stag” is apt because it stands in the middle of the Ben Damh deer estate.\n","description2":"The ascent of Beinn Damh starts from the Loch Torridon Hotel in Torridon village on the A896 road at grid reference  WikiMiniAtlasNG887541and follows the Allt Coire Roill for just over a kilometre, passing a 30-metre-high (98 ft) waterfall, the path then divides, the right fork climbs to the summit ridge by the easier route up the corrie of Toll Bàn while the left fork carries on up the glen to a small lochan at the head of the glen and then climbs by the steep north eastern ridge which skirts the difficult eastern buttress and requires some awkward scrambling in places to reach the highest point direct. Utilising both these routes, one for ascent, one for descent, gives a circuit of the mountain, with an out and back trip needed to climb the northern outlying top of Sgurr na Bana Mhoraire (687 metres), which is worth visiting for the fine views over Loch Torridon. The highest point of Beinn Damh lies at the southern end of the summit ridge and gives good views of nearby Beinn Alligin, Liathach and the Applecross hills as well as the Glen Carron Munros and Corbetts.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Beinn_Damh_from_Maol_Chean-dearg.jpg/800px-Beinn_Damh_from_Maol_Chean-dearg.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":441,"hillname":"Ben Vuirich","region":"06B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":903,"feet":2963,"gridref":"NN997700","gridref10":"NN 99726 70001","colgridref":"NN973708","colheight":558,"drop":345,"feature":"pointed stone 20m NNE of trig point in windshelter","observations":"stone 15m N of trig point is 5cm lower and stone 8m NNE of trig point is 10cm lower","survey":"Abney level","revision":"2012-08-15","comments":"","map50":"43","map25":"OL51E 394E","xcoord":299725,"ycoord":770009,"latitude":56.810737,"longitude":-3.644008,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Ben_Vuirich_from_the_Glen_Fernate_road_-_geograph.org.uk_-_296816.jpg/272px-Ben_Vuirich_from_the_Glen_Fernate_road_-_geograph.org.uk_-_296816.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ben_Vuirich_from_the_Glen_Fernate_road_-_geograph.org.uk_-_296816.jpg","description1":"Ben Vuirich (903 m) is a mountain in the Grampian Mountains of Scotland.

Despite being in a very wild and remote area, it can be easily ascended from a ruined roadside cottage 4 km to the east of its summit, where there is limited parking space. But the road is single track and the cottage is 20 miles from the nearest main road. Due to its isolation and insufficient height to qualify for Munro's Tables, Sgùrr nan Eugallt is infrequently climbed. \n","description2":"An old stalkers' path from the ruined cottage should guide the climber to a point just below a ridge at about 650 metres. The path was well built in its time but some sections have become wet and slippery. On gaining the ridge, turn left and follow the ridge to the 894 m triangulation point. The ridge becomes steep near the top but the steepest section can be bypassed. Contrary to the implication of the 1:50,000 Landranger map, several websites and the 1990 edition of the Scottish Mountaineering Club publication The Corbetts and other Scottish Hills, the true summit lies about 600 metres to the north west of the triangulation point.[1] List tickers should therefore turn right along the main ridge of the range and continue for about 600 metres to the main summit, which is not shown on any map. About 300 m further along the ridge is an 881 m summit, which is shown on topographic maps.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Eugallt.jpg/799px-Eugallt.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":491,"hillname":"Ben Tirran","region":"07B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":896,"feet":2940,"gridref":"NO373746","gridref10":"NO 37342 74607","colgridref":"NO287801","colheight":652,"drop":244,"feature":"trig point","observations":"","survey":"","revision":"2001-10-28","comments":"","map50":"44","map25":"OL53S 388S","xcoord":337342,"ycoord":774615,"latitude":56.858703,"longitude":-3.029169,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Glen_Clova_on_the_shortest_day_-_geograph.org.uk_-_638193.jpg/272px-Glen_Clova_on_the_shortest_day_-_geograph.org.uk_-_638193.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Glen_Clova_on_the_shortest_day_-_geograph.org.uk_-_638193.jpg","description1":"Ben Tirran (896 m) is a mountain in the Grampian Mountains of Scotland.

The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as \"cairn hill\",[1] This is thought to have originated because the hill was an important point on the ancient boundary between the kingdoms of the Picts and Dál Riata.[2] In recent years the hill has received some publicity after the discovery of a vein of gold on its slopes.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Beinn_Chuirn_and_Ben_Lui_1.jpg/796px-Beinn_Chuirn_and_Ben_Lui_1.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":763,"hillname":"Sgurr Mhurlagain","region":"10B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":880,"feet":2887,"gridref":"NN012944","gridref10":"NN 01263 94459","colgridref":"NM975948","colheight":365,"drop":515,"feature":"cairn","observations":"knoll 90m ENE at NN 01345 94495 is 5m lower","survey":"Abney level","revision":"2008-11-10","comments":"Section aligns with Corbett Tops booklet.

It is 879 metres (2,884 feet) high, and is classified as a Corbett. It lies about six kilometres (four miles) northwest of Callander, near the village of Kilmahog. It is situated in the Trossachs, an area often regarded as having some of the most romantic scenery in the Highlands.\n","description2":"Ben Ledi is particularly well known through Walter Scott's poem Lady of the Lake. Supposedly in ancient times,  Beltane rites were observed on the summit.[1] There are what is thought to be possible references to these Beltane rights in some of the Gaelic names on the mountain: Creag Ghorn; 'Rock of Embers' and Creag Loisgte; 'Burned Rock'. In 1791 the Rev Doctor James Robertson being minister of the parish at the time, was required to write a description of the parish for the First Statistical Account of Scotland. In his report he mistakenly (due to the similarity to le dia) took the name Ben Ledi to mean 'hill of god' which suited the purposes of the kirk of the day. The name is in fact a corruption of Beinn Leitir which translates to 'the Hill of the Slope', which is a very suitable description of the long south shoulder used to access the summit. A cairn was built on the top in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's jubilee.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Ben_Ledi_from_Kilmahog.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":212,"hillname":"Fraochaidh","region":"03B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":879,"feet":2884,"gridref":"NN029517","gridref10":"NN 02908 51703","colgridref":"NN091540","colheight":328,"drop":551,"feature":"cairn","observations":"","survey":"obvious summit","revision":"2001-10-28","comments":"","map50":"41","map25":"384","xcoord":202904,"ycoord":751712,"latitude":56.615678,"longitude":-5.213625,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":1,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Edge_of_track%2C_dense_forestry_with_Coire_Dubh_below_Fraochaidh_beyond_-_geograph.org.uk_-_920386.jpg/272px-Edge_of_track%2C_dense_forestry_with_Coire_Dubh_below_Fraochaidh_beyond_-_geograph.org.uk_-_920386.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edge_of_track,_dense_forestry_with_Coire_Dubh_below_Fraochaidh_beyond_-_geograph.org.uk_-_920386.jpg","description1":"Fraochaidh (879 m) is a mountain in the Grampian Mountains, located between Glen Coe and Oban on the west coast of Scotland.

The second-highest point in the Southern Uplands and the highest point in the Scottish Borders, it has an elevation of 840 metres, a prominence of 653 metres (and thus is a \"major\") and an isolation of 81 kilometres.[3] It is only 3 m (10 ft) lower than its parent, Merrick. Like many of its neighbours it is smooth, rounded and grassy, although the surrounding glens have very steep sides — country somewhat akin to the Cheviots or the Howgill Fells. The hill is most easily climbed from the Megget Stane to the south, beginning at an elevation of 452 m (1,483 ft), but is also frequently climbed from the villages near its base, or as part of a long, 50 km (30 mi) trek across the local area between the towns of Peebles and Moffat. On the summit is the highest VOR beacon in the UK,[4] and also a radio tower.\n","description2":"The summit of Broad Law is also the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Peeblesshire. It is also sometimes (erroneously) given as the county top of Selkirkshire. This is because in 1891, the area of Megget (a detached part of Lyne parish in Peeblesshire) was transferred to Yarrow parish in Selkirkshire. The administrative \"county\" boundary of Peeblesshire and Selkirkshire thus temporarily crossed Broad Law summit between 1891 and 1974. However, the historic county boundary remained several km to the east, where Dun Rig is the county top of Selkirkshire.[5]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Cramalt_Craig_view_to_Broad_Law.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":2374,"hillname":"Crag Hill [Eel Crag]","region":"34B","parent":2372,"classification":"Hu,Sim,Hew,N, W,B,Sy,Fel","metres":839.2,"feet":2753,"gridref":"NY192203","gridref10":"NY 19274 20333","colgridref":"NY 1860 2015","colheight":722.5,"drop":116.7,"feature":"no feature 35m S of trig point","observations":"30cm higher than trig point at NY 19270 20365.

It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale.

In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.\n","description2":"The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards[1] starts in the north, Birkett[2]  in the south and Wainwright[3]  employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey[4][5] and the Database of British and Irish Hills[6][7] listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. \n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Crinkle_Crags_from_Cold_Pike.jpg/800px-Crinkle_Crags_from_Cold_Pike.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":1982,"hillname":"Pen yr Helgi Du","region":"30B","parent":1965,"classification":"Sim,Hew,N","metres":832.6,"feet":2732,"gridref":"SH697630","gridref10":"SH 69781 63048","colgridref":"SH 6943 6334","colheight":747.8,"drop":84.7,"feature":"scattered cairn on W edge of summit","observations":"ground 5m SE of cairn is as high; ground 25m SE at SH 69792 63025 is 0.3m lower","survey":"Abney level/Trimble GeoXH 6000","revision":"2015-09-12","comments":"","map50":"115","map25":"OL17E","xcoord":269778,"ycoord":363045,"latitude":53.148595,"longitude":-3.948612,"country":"W","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":0,"Ma=":0,"Hu":0,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":1,"N":1,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":1,"Bg":1,"Y":0,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Helgi.JPG/272px-Helgi.JPG","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Helgi.JPG","description1":"Pen yr Helgi Du (Head or Hill of the Black Hound) is a mountain peak in the eastern part of the Carneddau in Snowdonia, North Wales.\n","description2":"It lies on the south-eastern flanks of Carnedd Llewelyn, and is linked to Carnedd Llewelyn over the col of Bwlch Eryl Farchog, a knife-edge ridge over the cliffs of Craig Yr Ysfa.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Helgi.JPG/512px-Helgi.JPG"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":2087,"hillname":"Cadair Berwyn","region":"30E","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,Sim,Hew,N, CoH,CoA","metres":832,"feet":2730,"gridref":"SJ071323","gridref10":"SJ 07165 32355","colgridref":"SJ017305","colheight":486,"drop":346,"feature":"rocky outcrop","observations":"","survey":"obvious summit/Trimble GeoXH 6000","revision":"2020-01-05","comments":"Higher than Moel Sych (hill 2089) which was formerly thought to be the historic Denbighshire County Top.

It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.\n","description2":"The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards[1] starts in the north, Birkett[2]  in the south and Wainwright[3]  employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey[4][5] and the Database of British and Irish Hills[6][7] listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. \n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Crinkle_Crags_from_Cold_Pike.jpg/800px-Crinkle_Crags_from_Cold_Pike.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":2302,"hillname":"The Cheviot","region":"33","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,Sim,Hew,N, CoH,CoU,CoA","metres":815,"feet":2674,"gridref":"NT909205","gridref10":"NT 90905 20523","colgridref":"NT403006","colheight":259,"drop":556,"feature":"trig point","observations":"ground 50m S at NT 90916 20477 and 120m W at NT 90783 20526 as high","survey":"Abney level","revision":"2001-10-28","comments":"","map50":"74 75","map25":"OL16E","xcoord":390906,"ycoord":620527,"latitude":55.478471,"longitude":-2.145443,"country":"E","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":0,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":1,"N":1,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":1,"CoA":1,"CoU":1,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":1,"Bg":1,"Y":0,"Cm":1,"T100":1,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":1,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Cheviot0410a.jpg/272px-Cheviot0410a.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cheviot0410a.jpg","description1":"The Cheviot (/ˈtʃiːviət/) is an extinct volcano and the highest summit in the Cheviot Hills and in the county of Northumberland.[1][5] Located in the extreme north of England, it is .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}1+1⁄4 miles (2 kilometres) from the Scottish border and, with a height of 2,674 feet (815 metres) above sea-level, is located on the northernmost few miles of the Pennine Way,[6] before the descent into Kirk Yetholm.\n","description2":"The volcano was formed by melting in the crust over 390 million years ago and has subsequently sustained intense erosion.[7] Several bodies of water radiate from The Cheviot.[8]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Cheviot0410a.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":1689,"hillname":"Corserine","region":"27B","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim,D","metres":814,"feet":2671,"gridref":"NX497870","gridref10":"NX 49785 87065","colgridref":"NX467854","colheight":326,"drop":488,"feature":"trig point","observations":"","survey":"","revision":"2001-10-28","comments":"","map50":"77","map25":"318","xcoord":249781,"ycoord":587068,"latitude":55.155082,"longitude":-4.35911,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":1,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":1,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Corserine.jpg/272px-Corserine.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Corserine.jpg","description1":"Corserine is a hill in the Rhinns of Kells, a sub-range of the Galloway Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland.

Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.  Brim Fell occupies a position in the northern section and therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights.

In October, Dafydd was executed at Shrewsbury on the orders of Edward I. His death marked the end of the 700-year rule of Gwynedd by the family descended from Cunedda Wledig and an independent Wales.[2]\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Beramawr.JPG/800px-Beramawr.JPG"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":1030,"hillname":"Beinn Airigh Charr","region":"14A","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":792,"feet":2598,"gridref":"NG930761","gridref10":"NG 93033 76173","colgridref":"NG944733","colheight":315,"drop":477,"feature":"cairn 10m NNE of trig point remains (NG 93027 76166)","observations":"","survey":"obvious summit","revision":"2015-03-27","comments":"","map50":"19","map25":"433 434 435N","xcoord":193030,"ycoord":876185,"latitude":57.727557,"longitude":-5.477609,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Beinn_Airigh_Charr_reflected_in_Loch_nan_Dailthean_-_geograph.org.uk_-_331328.jpg/272px-Beinn_Airigh_Charr_reflected_in_Loch_nan_Dailthean_-_geograph.org.uk_-_331328.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beinn_Airigh_Charr_reflected_in_Loch_nan_Dailthean_-_geograph.org.uk_-_331328.jpg","description1":"Beinn Airigh Charr (792 m) is a mountain in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland.

It is quite a large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water.\n","description2":"The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around 10 miles before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Grey Friar is the only major fell in the group not to stand on this main axis, rising to the west of Great Carrs across the depression of Fairfield.\n","img_hres_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Grey_Friar_and_harter_Fell_from_Great_Carrs.jpg/800px-Grey_Friar_and_harter_Fell_from_Great_Carrs.jpg"},{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"hillnumber":784,"hillname":"Meall a' Phubuill","region":"10D","parent":null,"classification":"Ma,C,Sim","metres":772.7,"feet":2535,"gridref":"NN029854","gridref10":"NN 02942 85408","colgridref":"NN092858","colheight":306,"drop":467,"feature":"cairn","observations":"rock 10m N of cairn at NN 02947 85418 may be as high","survey":"Leica RX1250","revision":"2019-08-04","comments":"","map50":"41","map25":"399","xcoord":202938,"ycoord":785418,"latitude":56.918009,"longitude":-5.239026,"country":"S","climbed":"","tumponly":0,"Ma":1,"Ma=":0,"Hu":1,"Hu=":0,"Tu":1,"Sim":1,"M":0,"MT":0,"F":0,"C":1,"G":0,"D":0,"DT":0,"Hew":0,"N":0,"Dew":0,"DDew":0,"HF":0,"W":0,"WO":0,"B":0,"Sy":0,"Fel":0,"CoH":0,"CoA":0,"CoU":0,"CoL":0,"SIB":0,"sMa":0,"sHu":0,"sSim":0,"s5":0,"s4":0,"Mur":0,"CT":0,"GT":0,"DN":0,"BL":0,"Bg":0,"Y":1,"Cm":0,"T100":0,"xMT":0,"xC":0,"xG":0,"xN":0,"xDT":0,"O":0,"Un":0,"P600":0,"P500":0,"wikiInfo":true,"img_thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Gleann_Fionnlighe_-_geograph.org.uk_-_221292.jpg/272px-Gleann_Fionnlighe_-_geograph.org.uk_-_221292.jpg","img_page_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gleann_Fionnlighe_-_geograph.org.uk_-_221292.jpg","description1":" Meall a' Phubuill (774 m) is a peak in the Northwest Highlands, Scotland, northwest of Fort William in Lochaber.\n","description2":"A rounded and grassy hill, it stands at the head of Glen Loy, in a little visited area covered by grass and heather moorland.
