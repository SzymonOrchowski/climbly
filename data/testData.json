        "description1": "Ben Macdui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mac Duibh, meaning \"Mac Duff's Hill\") is the second highest mountain in Scotland (and all of the British Isles) after Ben Nevis, and the highest in the Cairngorm Mountains and the wider Cairngorms National Park. The summit elevation is 1,309 metres (4,295 feet) AMSL. Ben Macdui lies on the southern edge of the Cairngorm plateau, on the boundary between the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire (currently on the border between the Aberdeenshire and Moray council areas).\n",
        "description2": "Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the 19th century it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain, and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be the higher. Following surveys of both peaks in 1846â€“47, Ben Nevis was confirmed as the higher.[3] Following these surveys, there were plans to build a cairn on the top of Ben Macdui to make its height greater than Ben Nevis, but these plans did not come to fruition.[4] The summit of the mountain has a direction indicator erected in 1925 by the Cairngorm Club of Aberdeen in memory of former president Alexander Copland. The indicator shows the directions of the most noteworthy mountains that can be seen from the summit in clear weather.[5]\n",
