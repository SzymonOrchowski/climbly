<h1>Climbly</h1>

Climbly is a hill collection app. Climbly was built for a final group project within NorthCoders bootcamp.

The application allows users to sign up, check off mountains or hills that they have climbed and view checked off mountains as pins on a UK map. Users are able to search for mountains based on name, height and location. Users can also check each locations weather ahead of time.
